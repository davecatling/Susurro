# Susurro
Susurro is a small Windows desktop application for anonymous end to end encrypted communications developed for my capstone project while studying the security engineering stream of a Master of Cyber Security degree with UNSW. It's development was intended to demonstrate how, within a short timeframe (< 2 months part time) and with negligible hosting costs a viable anonymous secure communication application could be developed without requiring specialised knowledge of encryption techniques using .NET core and the Azure platform.

A video demo using the front end which formed part of my uni submission can be viewed here: https://susurrostorage.blob.core.windows.net/deployment/ZZEN9209 â€“ Security Engineering Capstone.mp4
